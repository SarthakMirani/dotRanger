## ✨ What It Does

dotRanger helps you:
- Back up important config files from your Linux home directory
- Restore them on a fresh system with a single command
- Keep your dotfiles versioned and safe using Git

## 📦 Why I Built This

This tool is part of my personal learning journey.  
I built it to:
- Improve my Linux and Bash scripting skills
- Manage my system configs more cleanly
- Showcase my ability to build and maintain a real-world CLI tool

Yes, other tools like `dotdrop`, `stow`, and `dotsync` exist —  
but this is **handmade**, clean, and crafted for *my* workflow.
